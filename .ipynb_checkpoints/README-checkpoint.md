# Chem-surnames

What is the probability that a random English surname can be written using the symbols for chemical elements? (Eg. Clark = ClArK, which is Chlorine + Argon + Potassium.)

This question was suggested by Prof. Tomislav Došlić, who also provided a list of the most frequent surnames in UK.

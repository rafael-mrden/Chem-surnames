# Chem-surnames

What is the probability that a random English surname can be written using the symbols for chemical elements? (Eg. Clark = ClArK, which is Chlorine + Argon + Potassium.)

This question was suggested to me by Prof. Tomislav Došlić, who also provided a list of almost all surnames (with their frequencies) in UK.

See the Python 3 notebook "Chem-words.ipynb" for the answer.

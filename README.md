# Chem-words

What is the probability that a random English surname can be written using the symbols for chemical elements? (E.g., Clark = ClArK, which is Chlorine + Argon + Potassium.)

This question was suggested to me by Prof. Tomislav Došlić, who also provided the file `english_surnames.txt`, a list of almost all surnames (with their frequencies) in UK.

See the Python 3 notebook `chem-words.ipynb` for the answer.
